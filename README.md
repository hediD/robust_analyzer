Adversarial 3D Scene Parameters Optimization for Vision Models.

This project implements a framework for optimizing 3D scene parameters (camera position, texture, lighting) to analyze the robustness of vision models when classifying rendered 3D objects.

## Features
- Optimize camera positions, textures, and lighting parameters
- Support for environment maps as backgrounds
- Integration with Vision Transformer (ViT) for classification
- Robustness analysis optimization and visualization utilities

## Installation/Setup
- Create a new conda environment: `conda env create -f env.yml`
-  Activate environment: `conda activate torch3d`
- Install PyTorch and PyTorch3D: `bash extra_install.sh`
